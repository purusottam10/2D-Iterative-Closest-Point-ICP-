# 2D-Iterative-Closest-Point-ICP-
This is a 2D iterative closest point algorithm which is used to align two point clouds by finding the correspondence between the point clouds. 

In this we have taken a sine wave, which is the reference point cloud and we transformed it by multiplying with an arbitary transformation matrix and that transformed matrix we called it as the measured point cloud. And after that we 
ICP to the measured point cloud and reference point cloud and try to allign them by minimizing the rms error between the pointclouds.
